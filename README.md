# Robotics
Robot kinematics, dynamics, control and learning

This repository is mostly about manipulator robotics. I will write code about kinematic and dynamic simulation of robots. Also, I will
write controller code, both classical and modern, to control them. Finally, I will write code for robot learning.

# Basics of using git
## Clone a repository
To clone this repository, use

`git clone https://github.com/cawasthi/Robotics.git`
## Checking what you've changed

To see what files have changed and have not yet been committed, use

`git status`
## Adding changed files

To get a file ready to commit you need to add it. (This is because you must tell git which files it should save.) To add a single file use

`git add filename`

To add all of the changed files (that are currently tracked by git), use

`git add -u`
## Saving the changes

To save the changes, use the command

`git commit -m 'In quotes, give an explanation of your changes'`
## Uploading the changes

To upload the changes to the server, use:

`git push`
## Getting the newest versions

If something changed on the server version that you don't have, you can get the most recent files using:

`git pull`
